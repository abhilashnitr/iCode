You are given a string containing only 4 kinds of characters 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'.

A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n/4 times where n is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make the original string s balanced.

Return 0 if the string is already balanced.

/*
The idea is to first count up each type of character. Since we know there are only 4 characters: Q, W, E, R, we can
easily count them up using an int[] arr of length 4.

Then once we count them up, we look at the number of occurrences of each and see if any of them > N/4 (where N is the
length of the String). If they are, this means that we need this freq[character] - (N/4) number of this character in
the substring we choose to replace.

E.g. If we have N = 12 and freq[Q] = freq[0] = 6. Since we know each character must occur N/4 = 12/4 = 3 times. We have
3 extra Qs. So we need to make sure our substring at the end has 3 Qs in it. The same principle applies when there are
multiple characters > (N/4).

Essentially, we reduced the problem to finding a minimum substring containing a certain number of each character.

Then we go to the freq array and subtract (N/4) from each of freq[Q], freq[W], freq[E], freq[R].
If it is below 0 (this means our substring does not need to contain this letter since we are already in demand of this
letter), then we just set it to 0.

Then for our sliding window approach - see more: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/

We update freq[] so that freq[char] always represents how many characters we need still of each char to get the substring
that we need. It is okay for freq[char] to be < 0 as this mean we have more characters than we need (which is fine).
Each time we have an eligible substring, we update our minLen variable and try to shrink the window from the left as much as possible.

In the end we get the minimum length of a substring containing at least the characters we need to replace with other characters.

Forgive me for messy code - contest code can get a bit less elegant.
