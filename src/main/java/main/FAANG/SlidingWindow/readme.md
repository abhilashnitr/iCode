Problems such as finding longest substring or shortest substring with some contraints are mostly based on sliding window.

Basic template of such problems is basically 3 steps.

Step1: Have a counter or hash-map to count specific array input and keep on increasing the window toward right using outer loop.
Step2: Have a while loop inside to reduce the window side by sliding toward right. Movement will be based on constraints of problem. Go through few examples below
Step3: Store the current maximum window size or minimum window size or number of windows based on problem requirement.
