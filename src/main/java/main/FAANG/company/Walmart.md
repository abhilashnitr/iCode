Given two arrays of 0-9 integers
[6,8,0,0,5,6,7,6,7,4,3,6,9,9][5,9,6,7,4,3,5,6,8,3,5,6,7,6]Find which one of the two arrays will make the largest number if the digits are rearranged (Sorting is not allowed as he was looking for O(n) solution.

 Given a list of kingdoms on a linear line with start point and end point i.e. [(4,8), (8,9),(12,15),(2,5)]. Find the minimum number of bombs required to blow off all the kingdoms. The overlapping kingdoms need only 1 bomb i.e. in given example it will need 2 bombs because the merged kingdoms will look like [(2,9) (12,15)].

 Given a character array and a dictionary, find the no. of valid sentences that can be made by putting space after any character in this array. A valid sentence is the one whose all the words are present in the dictionary. Write code on paper.

 Input- catsanddog
 Output- 2 (cat sand dog & cats and dog)
 Given an array of random integer, find the maximum length of subsequence in it such that the elements of subsequence are consecutive.
 Given an array and a frog, there can be a bridge from any index to any index in forward direction and a tunnel from any index to any other index in backward direction. Froh is initially at -1 index. Given an integer k, from can hop at most k-1 times. i.e. if k=4 and frog initially is at -1, then it can reach cell 0,1,2 (3 hops at max). A frog on landing on a cell containing a bridge or a tunnel can avoid using that bridge or tunnel and stay there only. Find the minimum no. of steps in which the frog can reach a given destination ‘D’.
