Round1: LLD on already coded piece. Focus is on TDD
Round2: Detailed discussion around current projects/system. Certain questions around the existing design choices and different trade-offs (Two interviewers)
Round3: Design bill payments system where third-party are dynamically added. Some questions around functional paradigm and consistency guarantees with Kafka (Two interviewers)
Round4: This was the Bar Raiser round. Mostly behavioral questions
Round5: HR round on overall fitment

LLD Medium 1.5 hours. Explain past projects and its arch in detail. Describe the LLD for an event ingestion framework. Why I chose what I chose. Gave one medium problem on trees Then gave a new problem for which LLD had to be drawn neatly. Focus was given on domain design and entity modelling and even Leadership principles at Gojek.
System Arch / Design Medium Met a very friendly guy. Really expressive. Had to design something something like a location tracking system which scales to 1M users in a geographical region. Open ended. He asked me about what I would change at my current company.
Hiring Manager Hard Oh, this was hard. One of the hardest Hiring Manager rounds. He went in depth on my career, my decisions, why Gojek, debate on functional vs non functional paradigms, Gojek's focus on Clojure, why projects fail, why is software architecture different from construction architecture, how can you improve, what can you change. This really was one of the best HM's for me.

Interview : Take home assignment, 2 onsite tech interviews(previous xp then system design) and 1 hiring manager interview ---- No DS/Algo in any round
Interview experience :
Take home assignment - Easy to code up in two days, just need to follow SOLID + git + Unit tests + Good architecture.
Onsite tech 1 - Grill about previous projects, what decisions I took to solve a particular problem, questions on the domain that I've applied for.
Onsite tech 2 - Grill on advanced concepts, System desgin question which required me to give end to end solution, had to explain what's, why's and how's.
Hiring manager - Combination of tech1+tech2 and also culture fit questions

### Interview Round - 2 (Technical Interview 1):
There were panel of 2 interviewer and there was a deep discussion about my current/previous projects including design, implementation and whether I had used TDD approach for development. They asked a lot of questions just to check what understanding I actually have about my current/previous projects. This discussion went upto 45 min, then they asked me to design the data model and class diagram for any hotel booking system like OYO. I had given my approach, they asked a lot of cross question about my design.
### Interview Round - 3 (Technical Interview 2): 
This round too will make you sit opposite two interviewers and it had more focus on high level design and a little of low level design as well. They had asked me to design a system like google pay where they started with like 1000 users and went till 100M. This discussion was all about your design decisions and reason behind those decisions and how we can scale our system to this extent and what are the bottlenecks we will face while scaling.
### Interview Round - 4 (Bar Raiser round): 
This round mostly will be taken my VP or group manager where the conversation would revolve around our aspirations and expectations from Gojek, as well as their expectations from us. The interviewer asked me to write some REST APIs for library management and following with this some more technical questions to check if we can fit into their work culture and how quickly we can learn new things and adapt to their culture.


Then you get a parking lot problem which was an assignment to be completed and then 1st round will be the assessment of your solution for about 1.5hrs and extension of the problem and pair programming. Here the interviewer was nice and calm and helped me understand if stuck.
Second round was with 3 interviewer and 1hr time, they asked some questions regrading past projects and in-depth discussions on the technologies used. Then asked to design elevator. The discussion stretched more than 1hr and i had another meeting after that. I told them but still they extended the interview for 15min. I had to abruptly end it.

1. Round 1(Code pairing): Design Parking lot
2. Round 2: Design Elevator
3. Round 3: Design a system in which drivers of gojek are rolled out cashbacks based on their weekly rides count.

1st Round - Design parking lot on Machine. The interview was focused on low-level design along with test cases, method and variable naming, and minimum code change on adding a new feature. Initially, I started with a single level but later interviewer asked me to adapt the design to a multi-level parking lot.
2nd Round - Tech discussion around my previous projects with some modified criteria.
3rd Round - Design Food Ordering & delivery systems like Swiggy. This round was focused on high-level design.
4th Round - Bar Raiser. It majorly revolved around cultural fit i.e. how I am a team player, how I learn new stuff etc. It lasted around 30 mins.

Round 1(Pair Programming) questions regarding the assignment and extend the assignment to use multi storey parking lot.
Round 2 OOPs question on designing an ATM.

1. Take home assignment for weekend - design parking lot - test case oops
2. On site round1 extend the original code to multiple parking lot - test cases oops
3. Next round design ticket booking system
4. Next round design photo sharing app
5. Manager
