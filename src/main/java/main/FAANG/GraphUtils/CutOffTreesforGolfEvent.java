//You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:
//
//0 means the cell cannot be walked through.
//1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
//A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.
public class CutOffTreesforGolfEvent {

    //The idea is:
    //
    //Create a list of int[] which contains x_coordinate, y_coordinate, and height of tree
    //Add all the trees which have height >1 to the list.
    //Sort the given list based on their height, by using the Comparator class(or simply using Lambda expression from Java8)
    //Then traverse through each tree by using a BFS
    //In the BFS we are checking the distance needed to go to the tree from the current source coordinates(Since we have sorted the trees based on their height, our source coordinates will be different from the tree coordinates)
    //For eg: Our input is like this [[1,0,0],[1,0,0],[1,1,5]], then
    //i) We have only 1 entry to be traversed, which is {x,y,height} = {2,2,5}
    //ii) Once we have sorted the input trees, we are going to apply BFS
    //iii) Our source coordinates are (0,0) and our tree coordinates are (2,2) and then using BFS we are going to find out the shortest distance needed to to go from source to destination.
