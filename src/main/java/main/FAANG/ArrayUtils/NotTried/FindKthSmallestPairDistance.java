//Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is
// defined as the absolute difference between A and B.
//Input:
//nums = [1,3,1]
//k = 1
//Output: 0
//Explanation:
//Here are all the pairs:
//(1,3) -> 2
//(1,1) -> 0
//(3,1) -> 2
//Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
