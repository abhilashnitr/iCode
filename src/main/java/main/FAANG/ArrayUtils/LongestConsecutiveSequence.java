//Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
//Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
//Output: 9
