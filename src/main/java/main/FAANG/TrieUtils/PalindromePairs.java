//Given a list of unique words, return all the pairs of the distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the
//concatenation of the two words words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.
//Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
//Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
//Explanation: The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
