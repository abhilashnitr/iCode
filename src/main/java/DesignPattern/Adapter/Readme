The adapter pattern convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

Advantages:

Helps achieve reusability and flexibility.
Client class is not complicated by having to use a different interface and can use polymorphism to swap between different implementations of adapters.

Disadvantages:

All requests are forwarded, so there is a slight increase in the overhead.
Sometimes many adaptations are required along an adapter chain to reach the type which is required.
