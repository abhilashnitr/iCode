Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.
The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from
scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing object acts as
a prototype and contains the state of the object. The newly copied object may change
same properties only if required.

Prototype patterns is required, when object creation is time consuming, and costly
operation, so we create object with existing object itself.

Prototype Design Participants

1) Prototype : This is the prototype of actual object.

2) Prototype registry : This is used as registry service to have all prototypes accessible using simple string parameters.

3) Client : Client will be responsible for using registry service to access prototype instances.
